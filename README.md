# ayurveda-query-agent
This project uses Agno's agent framework and Gemini 1.5 Flash to create an AI assistant that can extract insights from a PubMed Ayurveda research paper. It answers user queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retains conversation history with memory, and sends summarized responses to the user via email using the Gmail API.
