# ðŸ§  Ayurveda Research Agent

An AI agent built using [Agno](https://docs.agno.ai) and Gemini 1.5 Flash that answers user questions based on a specific Ayurveda research paper and sends the responses to the userâ€™s email using SMTP via `agno.tools.email`.  
Includes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), conversation memory, and natural language reasoning.
